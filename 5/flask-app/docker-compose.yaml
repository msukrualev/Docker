# This Compose file defines two services: web and redis.
# The web service uses an image thatâ€™s built from the Dockerfile in the current directory. 
# It then binds the container and the host machine to the exposed port, 8000. This example service uses the default port for the Flask web server, 5000.
# The redis service uses a public Redis image pulled from the Docker Hub registry.
